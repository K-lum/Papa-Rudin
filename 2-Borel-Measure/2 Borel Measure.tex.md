## Tasks left
 - link to old definitions

# Positive Borel Measures

### Vector Space Definitions
 - *complex vector space*
 - *linear transformation*, *linear functional*, and *positive linear functional*

 ### Topological Definitions
 - *closed*, *closure*, *compact*, *neighborhood*
 - $X$ is *Hausdorff* when distinct elements of $X$ have disjoint neighborhoods
 - $X$ is *locally compact* when every point has a neighborhood with compact closure
 - $f$ is upper/lower semicontinuous if and only if 
 - $S$ is the *support* of $f$ on topological space X if it is the closure of $\{x: f(x) \neq 0\}$

### Topology Refresh

##### Heine-Borel Theorem
$$X\subset\mathbb{E}^n \text{ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded}$$

##### Several other little theorems

##### Urysohn's Lemma
$$\text{If } X \text{ is locally compact and Hausdorf, and } K \text{ is compact with } K \subset V \in \mathcal{T}_X \text{then there is a function  $$
